**Hi all, welcome to UBC STAT545 mini data analysis project!**

# Introduction

This is a data analysis project aimed for learning R programming. 

There are 3 milestones of this project:

## Milestone 1

- Become familiar with the dataset.

- Think of 4 questions that you would like to answer with your data.

- Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown.

## Milestone 2

- Become familiar with manipulating and summarizing your data in tibbles using ```dplyr``` and ```tidyr```, with a research question in mind.

- Understand what tidy data is, and how to create it.

- Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown.

- Gain a greater understanding of how to use R to answer research questions about your data.

## Milestone 3

- Manipulating special data types in R: factors and/or dates and times.

- Fitting a model object to your data, and extract a result.

- Reading and writing data as separate files.



please refer to the following course links to explore more informations:

- [x] [Milestone 3](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/mini-project/mini-project-3/)


# How to Download and Run

- Open your terminal and git clone the our code in the main branch to your local folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/mda-SylvieShen.git
```

- Open your **RStudio**, click **File** -> **Open Project...**, and find the repo downloaded before.

- Click source file `mda-SylvieShen.Rproj` to open the whole project.



# List of Files

Each folder with name ```MilestoneX``` (```X``` could be number of 1, 2 or 3, indicating the number of milestone) will contain the following files:

 - ```mini-data-analysis-X.Rmd```: source code of data analysis for different milestones. 

 - ```mini-data-analysis-X.md```: Readme version of ```.Rmd``` files.

 - ```mini-data-analysis-X_files```: folders containing all graphs in different ```.Rmd``` files.

Output folder contains the files generated from Milestone3.

Hope you enjoy the project! :blush:
